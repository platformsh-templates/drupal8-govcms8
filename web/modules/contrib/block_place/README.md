# Place Block

## Introduction

Allow administrators to place blocks from any Drupal page.

This was an Experimental -level module in Drupal 8.2 superseded
by Layout builder in Drupal 8.7.

Should you choose to continue using Place blocks with Drupal 9 you
can do it with this contributed module, which is continuity of the
deprecated core module.

## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.

See:
[https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules)
for further information.

## Configuration

No configuration is needed. 

## Using the module

Enable module and you should see a "Place block"  -link in th Toolbar if current use has a _administer blocks_ -permission. 

Clicking the link reveals regions where you can add blocks. Add block to a region clicking the icon, and selecting the desired block to be placed.
