This template builds the Australian government's GovCMS Drupal 8 distribution using the [Drupal Composer project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) for better flexibility.  It is pre-configured to use MariaDB and Redis for caching.  The Drupal installer will skip asking for database credentials as they are already provided.

GovCMS is a Drupal distribution built for the Australian government, and includes configuration optimized for managing government websites.

## Features

* PHP 7.4
* MariaDB 10.4
* Redis 6
* Drush and Drupal Console included
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Composer-based build

## Post-install

Run through the GovCMS installer as normal.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to Drupal 8 / GovCMS as it is downloaded from Drupal.org.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* It uses the Drupal Composer project, which allow the site to be managed entirely with Composer. That also causes the `vendor` and `config` directories to be placed outside of the web root for added security.  See the [Drupal documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2404989) for tips on how best to leverage Composer with Drupal 8.
* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Composer library, [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
* The `settings.platformsh.php` file contains Platform.sh-specific code to map environment variables into Drupal configuration. You can add to it as needed. See the documentation for more examples of common snippets to include here.  It uses the Config Reader library.
* The `composer.json` file has been modified to skip the `phing push` step, as that results in the entire site being duplicated within the install profile.
* The `settings.php` file has been heavily customized to only define those values needed for both Platform.sh and local development.  It calls out to `settings.platformsh.php` if available.  You can add additional values as documented in `default.settings.php` as desired.  It is also setup such that when you install Drupal on Platform.sh the installer will not ask for database credentials as they will already be defined.
